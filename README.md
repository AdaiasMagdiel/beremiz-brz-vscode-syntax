# Beremiz VS Code Extension

Syntax highlighting support for the **Beremiz** language (`.brz` files) in Visual Studio Code.

This extension is intended for use with [Beremiz](https://github.com/AdaiasMagdiel/Beremiz-Go) (stack-based toy programming language implemented in Go).  
It provides syntax coloring, comment support, and basic editor features for `.brz` source files.
